# teleporter

A **'cd'** script written in Node.js and bash. Users may map any key to their directories. These `key` => `dir` pairs are stored inside LevelDB for quick retrieval.

Hopefully this reduces the number times one must press tab and type `cd` to enter directories.

## Setup

Given the nature of how scripts/programs are typically executed in a child process, `cd`s in scripts/programs do not exactly last after completion. 
**Note** The reference to `teleporter` below is the actual file called **teleporter**

Here's a list of things that should be taken into consideration:
* Make **symlinks** of **teleporter** and **pathfinder.js** and place them inside `~/scripts/` or where ever , but make sure that call to **pathfinder.js** is in the same directory specified in **teleporter**
* Source **teleporter** symlink or actual (**MUST DO** or else `cd` of `pwd` does not stay after execution completion)
